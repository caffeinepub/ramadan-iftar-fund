## Current State
The website includes a "Transparency & Accountability" section with two cards:
1. Student Verification card (left) - shows coordinator name, contact numbers, and verified SVU badge
2. Expense Breakdown card (right) - shows cost breakdown per meal

## Requested Changes (Diff)

### Add
- None

### Modify
- None

### Remove
- Remove the "Student Verification" card from the Transparency section
- Keep only the "Expense Breakdown" card, centered on the page

## Implementation Plan
1. Remove the Student Verification Card component from App.tsx
2. Adjust grid layout to center the remaining Expense Breakdown card

## UX Notes
The transparency section will now focus solely on financial breakdown without student coordinator details, providing a cleaner layout with the expense information centered.
